# A (Crossplane) ResourceDefinition defines a new kind of Crossplane resource. A
# controller watches for this kind and creates CustomResourceDefinitions. This
# type allows us to simplify the CRD authorship process, removing footguns (like
# not enabling the status subresource), and injecting schema to allow Crossplane
# machinery.

  # Features of this Crossplane resource. A feature flags this kind of resource
  # as having support for a particular feature. This may involve injecting the
  # schema required to support that feature into the resource's CRD.

  # - This resource is a composite; it should have composition machinery.
  # - This resource is connectable; it should have connection secret machinery.
  # - This resource is an OAM workload; we should publish a WorkloadDefinition.
